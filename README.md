# Hi!

This is my second web application. It's a simple task management app that **allows you to mark tasks as done and delete them**.
The goal is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use tool for managing your tasks and to-do list.
**Feel free to use it**, and Iâ€™d love to hear any feedback or suggestions for improvements!
